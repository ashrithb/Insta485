# Insta485
Simulated social network experience with ReactJS to provide visually appealing client-side dynamic pages. Utilized HTML, CSS, Jinja, Flask and python to render server-side dynamic pages and REST API. 

Here are some sample screenshots of what one of the profiles looks like: ![profilePage](https://github.com/ashrithb/Insta485/assets/92128095/aa401e94-0912-4d90-8df4-11774a58a0bf)

I used an SQL database to store all the information in each of the pages, including login info with hashed passwords, likes, users and their posts, comments, etc:![backendDB](https://github.com/ashrithb/Insta485/assets/92128095/b9781e87-365b-4e11-8cb7-33fa472a0a73)
